**# TPOT COBEN**
program that uses vote data inputted manually from bracketcounter to generate a COBEN list (due to bracketcounter not being 100% accurate). this is a reverse engineer of code made by ```teedster``` in htwins central
# How to Use
Open ```bfb_coben.py``` in Visual Studio Code or Notepad (any text/code editor)
Edit the variables at the beginning to your desire (contestants, vote counts, margin of error (contestant_se), total simulations) (do note you would need to rename the variables if you want to change the characters, I'd recommend a find and replace tool to do this easily)
# Running the Code
There are two ways I've successfully tried running the code.
**1. Visual Studio Code**
a) Open the code with Visual Studio Code, then run it with the play button.
**2. Command Prompt**
Sometimes, I have a terminal connection error! This is how I run it when that happens.
a) Open cmd.exe
b) Use ```cd``` to the path where ```bfb_coben.py``` is stored.
c) Run ```python bfb_coben.py```
